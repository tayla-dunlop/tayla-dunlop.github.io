      <h2>A Wonderful Discussion on IQ & EQ</h2>
<p>What is Emotional Intelligence                                                                                   Emotional intelligence is how us as people process and react in emotional ways. This can be between each other, or on our own. It is a set of skills that are essential to working in a team, it helps with communication and problem solving. It is also how we process our own emotions.
  How is it different to IQ?                                                                                                 Emotional Intelligence is as you can guess, the emotional side of things. Whereas IQ is about the non physical academic side of things.
  Why is it important?                                                                                                             Emotional intelligence is so important to understand yourself. With really good emotional support, you are able to understand when emotions change, how your mind and body deals with it, and know how to u get back on track.
