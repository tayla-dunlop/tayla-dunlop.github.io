     <h1>A Wonderful Reflection of my Journey so Far...</h1>

     <p>
       During this 5 weeks, I have learnt far more than I ever thought I would be able to 
       in such a small amount of time. Here I am going to explore what exactly I have learnt and how it has 
       impacted me.
     </p>
     <h3 class="text-left">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
     
      <p class="text-left">
        Three new things I'd say I have learnt would be; firstly that maybe I am not as easily motivated as I previously thought.
        Although my motivation doesn't slow me down, it has sometimes been a challenge in these last 5 weeks because I have had to face
        challenges harder than ever. Secondly I would say my mindset. When we started to learn about growth mindsets I had surprised myself!
        As I've mentioned before, I'm not perfect yet but my growth mindset is definitely on the road to success! Lastly I have learnt
        that I am able to express myself and my learning through reflecting. Reflecting was something that I never overly enjoyed but 
        as I kept practicing it, it was a great way for me to express how I had felt for each challenge and how I learnt.

      <h3 class="text-left">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>

      <p class="text-left">
        All 3 of these aspects, values, empathy, and self-awareness play huge parts in learning and programming. Values has always been important
        to me no matter where I am, as it is important for me to understand my limits and stand for what I am and believe in.
        Empathy is also just as important as values. Empathy is the basis of being able to work with others, as it is how we understand each
        other in a way. Empathy allows us to understand and share feelings with another being. Here is an image that i found super powerful
        for empathy.

        Laslty is self-awareness. I find this one links with values as you must be self-aware to understand and stick by your 
        values. Self-awareness contributes to learning in a way that you need to be aware and know what your body needs and is asking of 
        you for you to be able to learn in the best way you can. I like to think of these three aspects as part of Te Whare Tapa Wha (even though theres only 3)
        as rather then the foundations of well being, but the foundations of learning and growth.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-left">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>

      <p class="text-left">
        The core learning has surprised me in terms of how much almost every single person lacks these kinds of skills.
        I come from hospitality where I am constantly surround by and working with people so I always assumed that the core side of 
        things would come easier to me, but sometimes that wasn't true. I think that people sometimes need to take a step back 
        and focus on the core side of things rather than the go go go attitude.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-left">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>

      <p class="text-left">
        For me, I think that I struggled the most with listening and looping. I've always known that I am a pretty useless listener,
        and it was defintely highlighted during these exercises. It's not that fact that I don't want to listen, but I always want to
        jump in and add an idea, or give advice, or just add something! It is something I will need to keep working on.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-left">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>

      <p class="text-left">
        As I slightly mentioned before, it was surprising to me how so many people lack these core skills and need them alot more 
        than they may think, and thats exactly why I think we are being taught it during this course.
        The other week I was out socialising and bumped into someone who works with javascript in their job. They were telling me about how 
        they had to go through someones code(apparently there was about 400 pages) and descramble it so that it was actually readable for
        other people. It made me think about why we are learning these core skills, sure it is easy enough to write 400 pages of code, but
        what is the use in that when not a single person can read or understand it. Thats why I think these core skills are so valuable, because
        we are learning how to work with other people and understand our own feelings at the same time.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-left">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer. </h3>
      <p class="text-left">
        A lot of the time, I really enjoyed doing the core exercises. It was great way to learn about myself and others aswell as have a 
        break from all the technical coding. There were times when I thought to myself that maybe these exercises were pointless, or I didnt
        need them, but I think the case was more that maybe I wasn't going to see instant changes and it would take practice and patience.
