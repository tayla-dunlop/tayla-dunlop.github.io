      <h1>A Wonderful Exploration of my Core Values</h1>
      <p class="text=left">
        A core value of mine is willingness to the unknown. For example, I myself have never in my life thought about being a developer and going into that industry, yet here I am ready to try something so new and so unknown to me. I believe that I have just enough trust in myself and my peers around me who support me that I am able to confidently jump into the unknown and know that I will be totally okay and totally looked after. <div>

Another core value to me is support. I'm not really sure if this falls under a value however support is so so important to me, both giving and receiving it! For example, as I mentioned above, Having such strong support around me allows me to do crazy new exciting and sometimes even scary things in my life and know that I'll come out the other side totally fine. Also, having the ability to give support is so important to me because in turn it supports me! (if that makes sense). For example, a few years ago my best friend went through a horrible breakup and she needed all the support she could get. Being my best friend, she has been one of my strongest supports through everything si it was important for me to support here too.<div>

An ethnical decision i had to make one time was about 2 years ago. I had flown over to germany on January 25th 2020 to participate in a 6 month  exchange. Obviously we all know covid hit the world in 2020 and for a while i was stranded in germany. By about mid april, half way through my exchange there was an opportunity to come home. Straight away it seemed to be the best option, as there was the unknown looming over me about whether i'd ever be able to get back home. Now, although this seemed like the best time for me to come back home, my host family in Germany did not. They were really hoping for me to stay for the whole 6 months. The decision was down to me whether i'd go home and be safely home or stay for the entire 6 months. In the end it came  down to support for me, although i am so grateful for my host family in germany, i just felt as though i didn't have enough support for all this unknownn so i decided i had to come home.<br>

I identify as a wahine maori. All i can't say about my culture is that it is incredible. In the sense of how it has influenced my values i'd say it has. My culture is HUGE on whanau (family) which can mean many things, including support!

My strengths and limitations with learning and career development. I've always thought that I have a secret strength that people don't necessarily notice all the time is communication. Although i can sometimes be a shy person in the beginning, but once i push through that barrier I am extremely good at being able to put my thoughts in my head into actual words and get the message out. In terms of limitations, the sky is my limit :))))
