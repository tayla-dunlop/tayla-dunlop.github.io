      <h1>The Wonders of Javascript!</h1>
      <p class="text-left">
        Javascript can be an extremely intimidating language of code, especially when first learning it.
        However, once you understand the basics it is such a valuble skill to have in the software developing world
         (javascript is the heart of all modern day big websites).
      </p>

        Lets start by discussing Javascripts relationship with HTML & CSS.
        To phrase it in the simplist way possible HTML is the content, so the writing that you are reading 
        right now. CSS is the styling, so how you are seeing it all (colours, backgrounds, etc). And javascript, 
        is the cherry on top. Javascript controls the behaviour of the different elements.
        Together with all 3 of these things working in sync, you are able to create an unstoppable website, crazy right!
        To relate it to something maybe a little less nerdy, lets look at it in everyday life! Take a cake for example (a cartton cake
        to be exact), it has three layers. The cake itself is the first layer and I would think of this as the html. The second layer
        is the icing, which would be the CSS (since it makes it look pretty!). And last layer, the cherry on top! Now a cake can survive
        without a cherry on top, but it just makes it so much better right? Same goes for javascript.

        Now, lets briefly discuss loops and control flow. Loops can be extremely confusing and intimidating in the begininng 
        so its always a good idea to try and simplify it by comparing it to something in your everyday
        life!
        For example, I like to compare loops to breathing. Loops are something that repeats itself over and over again until 
        something is false. Now I know you are probably thinking 'Tayla, how the heck does breathing relate to loops???'. 
        Well, in my crazy mind I like to think of it like this, from the day we are born, we teach ourselves 
        how to breathe. This stays on loop for our whole lives until something in our body says false! (lets hope that it old age).
        Now I know that is probably the worst example you have ever heard, but it works for me!
        There is also this crazy other thing called control flow. Now, contol flow is basically how your computer runs code from top to bottom.
        Like reading, it starts at the top and makes its way down, unless it something is telling it not to, like loops!
        </p>

        Now, onto another topic! Let's talk about the DOM. The DOM stands for Document Object Model(DOM).
        It represents a page and what is on it. The DOM can also be intimidating in the beginning, or
        it can be super fun! How the heck do you use the  DOM and certainly how can it be fun you might ask;
        Well let me tell you! The other day I learnt all about the DOM for the first time aswell, so I decided why 
        not have a play around and get more comfortable with it? By the end of it, I had changed a website that was all about developing
        and made it entirely about christmas! It was such a fun way to learn more about the DOM, and be less intimidated by it. But how did 
        I actually interact with it? Well the DOM is super cool like that, there is a feature that allows you to click on any part of 
        the webpage it will show you all the code on that specific section. This meant I could use the DOM and click on any part
        of the webpage and change the code. It was super satisfying and fun.
        </p>

        <p class="text-left">
        Time to talk about objects and arrays. I know that especially for a non-tech person, this whole page is probably putting 
        you to sleep, so I will keep this one brief. Objects and arrays hold data, and we can access that data! Although both objects and arrays
        do hold data, they are accessed differently. Arrays are done in sequence meaning that it can be hard 
        to find things sometimes. However with objects, it is done directly!
        Now, when is it best to use arrays, and best to use objects? A single entity with named properties would be best for objects,
        if its a group with the same type/shape or if the order matter then it would be better for an array. 
        The difference between arrays and objects is the brackets, object use {} and arrays use[]. here is a screenshot of code as an example 
        of when to use each of them.

        Lastly, lets touch on functions. If you read my page on classes vs ids in CSS, this is somewhat similar.
        A function is a little container of code that has been given a task to perform. Functions also have their own set of methods that can be applied to 
        them to make other cool things happen, like toString method which makes it a string. Now, why would we use functions?
        Well, functions can be used over and over again and its also a great way for coders to break a problem down into smaller chunks of code.
        Functions, in my opinion are extremely importan. Maybe because they were the first things I used while learning javascript,
        but they are these awesome containers carrying instructions and tasks to perform!
        It is also important to remember that to call a function, you have to declare it first.
        this is where classes are in common! You can't apply a class without creating it first, right? Well, it is the exact same as with functions,
        you need to declare it before you can call it!

        Thats all I will be covering in this page, I hoped you learnt something, this is still very new to me aswell!
