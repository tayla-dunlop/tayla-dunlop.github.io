    <h2>My Wonderful Learning Plan</h2> 
    <h3 class="text-left">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3> <p class="text-left"> My long-term goal is to complete this course and join the software developer workforce and eventually build my way up from there by gaining more experience.</p> <div>


    </div>
     <h3 class="text-left">A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning.</h3><p class="text-left"> In terms of learning, my main strength would be my motivation. I am a glass half full kind of person which I think greatly contributes to my motivation. Even when I’m stuck or learning something that I may not be that passionate about, I still seem to have a strong sense of motivation which helps me to get my work done in certain timeframes. My limitations for learning are myself. Although I feel good about my motivation, I can be extremely self-critical. Sometimes it will cause me to second guess myself and then I slow myself down.</p> <div>


      </div>
      <h3 class="text-left">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>  <p class="text-left">Although I believe I can be a good communicator, it takes me a while to get comfortable with new people which means it takes me a while to start communicating well with a new person. During this course I would love to learn how to trust myself and be more comfortable with working with people who I don't know and being able to communicate well straight off the bat.</p>
      <h3 class="text-left">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>
      <p class="text-left">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.                                                                                                                     I will ALWAYS keep an open mind, this will help me a lot with working with new people. My motivation must stay strong as well! And most importantly, be kind (to others but i also need to remember myself!)
     What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.                       Take a break. Reach out for support, I have an incredible support stream behind me who are constantly reminding me they are there for me whenever I need it. I will also let a facilitator know that things are starting to build up.</p>
      <h3 class="text-left">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>                            <p class="text-left"> If I encounter a problem I will give myself 10 minutes on it, if I haven't figured it out I will reach out to my peers in discord (or in person during bootcamp), if I still have not resolved the problem it is time to reach out to a facilitator.</p>
      <h3 class="text-left">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h3>                                                <p class="text-left"> I expect to feel supported from the facilitation team (which they are already doing so well!) and also to get the right help at the right time (after going through my peers).</p>
      <h3 class="text-left">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>                                                                             <p class="text-left">The only time I would commit to booking out is my sleep! I must have a good sleep.</p>
