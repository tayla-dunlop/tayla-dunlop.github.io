    <h1>My Wonderful Learning Plan</h1> 
    <h2>Foundations</h2>
    <h3 class="text-left">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3> 
    <p class="text-left"> 
      My long-term goal is to complete this course and join the software developer workforce and 
      eventually build my way up from there by gaining more experience.</p> <div>


    </div>
     <h3 class="text-left">A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning.</h3>
     <p class="text-left">
        In terms of learning, my main strength would be my motivation. I am a glass half full kind of
         person which I think greatly contributes to my motivation. Even when I’m stuck or learning something 
         that I may not be that passionate about, I still seem to have a strong sense of motivation which helps me
          to get my work done in certain timeframes. My limitations for learning are myself. Although I feel good 
          about my motivation, I can be extremely self-critical. Sometimes it will cause me to second guess myself and 
          then I slow myself down.</p> <div>


      </div>
      <h3 class="text-left">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>  <p class="text-left">Although I believe I can be a good communicator, it takes me a while to get comfortable with new people which means it takes me a while to start communicating well with a new person. During this course I would love to learn how to trust myself and be more comfortable with working with people who I don't know and being able to communicate well straight off the bat.</p>
      <h3 class="text-left">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>
      <p class="text-left">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.                                                                                                                     I will ALWAYS keep an open mind, this will help me a lot with working with new people. My motivation must stay strong as well! And most importantly, be kind (to others but i also need to remember myself!)
     What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.                       Take a break. Reach out for support, I have an incredible support stream behind me who are constantly reminding me they are there for me whenever I need it. I will also let a facilitator know that things are starting to build up.</p>
      <h3 class="text-left">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>                            <p class="text-left"> If I encounter a problem I will give myself 10 minutes on it, if I haven't figured it out I will reach out to my peers in discord (or in person during bootcamp), if I still have not resolved the problem it is time to reach out to a facilitator.</p>
      <h3 class="text-left">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h3>                                                <p class="text-left"> I expect to feel supported from the facilitation team (which they are already doing so well!) and also to get the right help at the right time (after going through my peers).</p>
      <h3 class="text-left">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>                                                                             <p class="text-left">The only time I would commit to booking out is my sleep! I must have a good sleep.</p>

      <h2>Bootcamp</h2>

      <h3 class="text-left">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      
      <p class="text-left">
        Not much will change for me with this one, except that I would also love to gain more experience in the
        human skills side of things.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="text-left">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
      
      <p class="text-left">
        I think a strength of mine that has helped me so far is that I am so fresh out of highschool and still in the swing of 
        studying and learning. This will continue to help me through bootcamp aswell as that I am super excited to meet new people!
        My limitations will again be my self-critical voice inside my head, but I will get there!
      </p>
     
      <h3 class="text-left">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>

      <p class="text-left">
        Although I am super excited to meet everyone, I think my biggest non technical challenge will be getting comfortable
        with everyone. Although, I have heard from past graduates that since this course is so hard and so intense, you become
        comfortable with your peers a lot quicker, so we will see.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-left">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>

      <p class="text-left">
      This hasnt changed for me, I would just love to learn to be more comfortable working with people I dont know.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-left">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>

      <p class="text-left">
      Pretty simple, be a really nice perrson (everyone here is really really nice), and give me the support I need
      when I reach out for it.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-left">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
      
      <p class="text-left">
        My expectations of myself during bootcamp are honestly the bare minimums. I turn up everyday ready to learn and 
        ready to be myself! As well as reach out for help when I know I need it.
