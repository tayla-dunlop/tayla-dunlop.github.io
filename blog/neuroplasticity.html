      <h1>Wonderous Neuroplasticity</h1>

      <p class="text-left">Research Neuroplasticity
        According to CNS (center for neuro skills), there are 10 important principles to remember 
        about neuroplasticity: Use it or lose it , Use it and improve it , specificity , repetition matters ,
         intensity matters , time matters , salience matters , age matters , generalization , 
         and lastly Interference.     As you can tell, all of these are extremely important with neuroplasticity 
         and if you can practice these 10 principles while learning, you will be a happy genius in no time! </p>



         <p class="text-left">During this course, it is super important for me to practice those principles as I am learning so many
            new things in such a short time, it is important that I build super strong connections in my brain so I
             can put them to use as soon as possible.                                                                                         
              What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?                                      
              Same as the 10 principles above,  practice, repeat, and so on! </p>


              <p class="text-left">I found this link and I thought it was super helpful in terms of understanding how you c
                an improve your neuroplasticity, take a look :)

              <p class="text-left">Research Growth Mindset                                                                                         
                Growth mindset is such a valuable skill to have, it gives you the ability to have a positive, growth mindset 
                when faced with challenge or failure. With a growth mindset, failure is not seen as a negative or bad thing, 
                instead it's a chance to learn and grow! Growth mindset is also such a relevant skill to have! If you can train 
                your mind to understand that your brain is malleable and trainable, you can teach yourself and grow yourself limitlessly.  </p>

                

                <p class="text-left">While researching and exploring a growth mindset I began to realize that although it's not perfect yet, I already have
                   the beginnings of a growth mindset!                                                                                                                    
                    I will try to integrate a growth mindset throughout this course by tackling every challenge with a smile! I am here to 
                    learn new things and I am super excited about that :))                                                                                          
                    Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.

                  <p class="text-left">Blend with your learning plan and strategies                                              
                    Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.                                                                                      
                    I believe that I created my learning plan with a growth mindset in mind, now the most important thing to do is 
                    to put it to practice!!</p>
