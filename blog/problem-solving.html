        <h1>The Wonderful Problem Solving</h1>
         <h3 class="text-left">How I get Unstuck...</h3>
          <p class="text-left">
            During this weeks sprint (sprint 4), I encountered
             many problems. My first step, like most people is to spend no 
             more than 10 minutes on the problem. Most of the time 10 minutes actually does the trick 
             and I am able to work through the problem myself, but sometimes 
             I need to take other actions.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            The other day, during the gradebook kata exercise I found myself
            getting an error message that I just couldn't seem to understand.
            I kept trying to change little bits of code or move different words
            around but nothing seemed to help. So, I went onto discord to reach 
            out for help from my peers. Turns out there was someone having the exact same problem as me!
            We started chatting to see what might be happening and it turns out they 
            were just super little typos. In the end, the other person had noticed my
            little typo and I had noticed hers, so sometimes all it needs is a fresh 
            pair of eyes.
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            I also took that scenario as a small win. Since all this is so new to me,
            I haven't really had the ability to help anyone as I don't understand it myself! 
            But that day I was finally able to help someone with actual code! It made me feel like maybe all the confusion
            is actually starting to click which was super validating. (yes I know it was just a typo I picked up on
            but I love taking the small wins!)

         <h3 class="text-left">Problem Solving Techniques</h3>
          <p class="text-left">
            This sprint has taught me many new techniques to help with my problem solving, some of them are still very new to me 
            but some are super helpful! Here is a list of the techniques that I will be briefly touching on.
            <ul class="text-left">
              <li>Psuedocode</li>
              <li>Trying Something</li>
              <li>Rubber Ducky Method</li>
              <li>Reading error messages</li>
              <li>Console.logging</li>
              <li>Googling</li>
              <li>Asking Peers for Help</li>
              <li>Asking Facilitators for Help</li>
              <li>Improving your Process with Reflection</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            If I can practice, and get really good at using all these problem solving techniques, I will be 
            almost unstoppable. Because as said before, I am not here to be become a professional coder, I am Here
            to become a professional problem solver!
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            At the moment, my go to problem solving techniques from above are googling, asking peers for help, Reading
            error messages, trying something, and the rubber ducky method. These 5 I feel super comfortable and confident with
            in terms of solving my problems when I'm stuck. With reflecting, it is something that I've had to practice for many years 
            so it comes naturally to me, which is an advantage for improving my process.
         </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            Lastly is Psuedocode, console.logging and asking Facilitators
            for help. I had a go at Pseudocode for the first time this week and it was a bit weird, but I think with
            practice it will become super helpful. Console.logging is something I have never tried. Since javascript is still
            such a new daunting language I am trying to learn I'm still finding my feet, but I will definitely give it a go 
            sometime soon. Lastly is asking my facilitators. In my head, I have classed this the last resort (not really sure why but anyway)
            and it turns out that up until now, I still havent had to go to the last resort because everything else has been so helpful!
          </p>
          <p class="text-left">
            I hope you enjoyed my wonderfulness and maybe learnt something!
